# Babel of Code

## My thoughts

*Lua-likes.* I only took a look at original languages that cleanly compile to Lua without dragging their own runtime or standard library along, and there are only two mainstream options fitting the description. [Fennel](https://fennel-lang.org/) is simply Lua with a Lisp syntax and not much of an ergonomic improvement over Lua… Unlike [YueScript](https://yuescript.org/) - a fork of the dormant MoonScript - which actually has features (eg. array comprehension) that make Lua easier to write in, although the syntax may be a bit too sugary in some places. Of course, those are not the only possibilties available to you since there do exist Lua transpilers for a plethora of other established programming languages, including but not limited to: C#, Idris, JavaScript, Oberon, Python, Ruby, Rust, Standard ML.
